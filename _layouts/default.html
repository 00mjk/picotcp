        <h3 id="modularity"><span class="fa-stack fp-icons"><i class="fa fa-sitemap fa-stack-2x"></i></span><a href="#header-3"></a>&nbsp;<strong>Modularity</strong></h3>
  <p>Each component of the stack is contained in a separate module, allowing the user to select at compile time what needs to be included for any specific platform. This allows you to free up memory and resources, which are often mission-critical for a project.</p>

        <h3 id="portability"><span class="fa-stack fp-icons"><i class="fa fa-cogs fa-stack-2x"></i></span><a href="#header-3"></a>&nbsp;<strong>Portability</strong></h3>
  <p>The provided APIâ€™s are lightweight, well documented and give you access to the librarie's features, both from the applications and from the device drivers point of view. The APIs facilitate the integration with the surroundings and minimize the time needed to integrate the stack with existing code.</p>

  <p>picoTCP guarantees production grade quality by applying extensive unit tests, functional tests, a whole range of RFC compliance tests, together with static and dynamic code analysis.</p>

<h2 id="connected-devices"><strong>Connected Devices Services</strong></h2>
  <p>picoTCP is an important part of Altran Belgium's <i>connected devices</i> engineering services, that provides an answer to the Internet of Things challenges. Does your new products need connectivity, either to communicate with each other, an end-user or to your business applications? <a href="mailto:picotcp.belgium@altran.com">Let us help you with our expertise</a>!</p>

  <p>Any (connected) device typically needs some of below expertise areas which we cover with our services:</p>

  <h4 id="connecting"><img src="assets/images/computer-cpu.png" alt=""> <strong>Connecting Devices</strong></h4>
  <p>The core of the challenge. Which technologies are suitable for your product? What's the best topology for your network? Which cloud infrastructure do you want to integrate with? What protocol to use and how to implement it on your device? Whether existing or new products/devices, Altran can assist you in every step.</p>

  <h4 id="improving"><img src="assets/images/key.png" alt=""> <strong>Improving Devices</strong></h4>
  <p>Some devices only have to transmit sensor values, while others perfom local processing and possibly even local decision making. Device intelligence might be optional, but security, safety and reliability are not. With +30 years of experience in embedded software, we've grown to be the experts you need.</p>

  <h4 id="optimizing"><img src="assets/images/profits.png" alt=""> <strong>Optimizing Delivery</strong></h4>
  <p>When building software for potentially thousands of devices, reliable and efficient software delivery is essential. We can optimize your software processes and methodologies, set up a hardware-in-the-loop test automation framework and assist you in continuous software delivery.</p>
