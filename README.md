Getting Started
---------------

Welcome to the one and only PicoTCP repository. Here's what you should do to get the stack compiled, and some tests running on a linux system:

* Open your favourite terminal
* git clone git://github.com/tass-belgium/picotcp.git
* cd picotcp
* make
* sudo apt-get install vde2
* sudo apt-get install libvdeplug2_dev
* sudo ./test/autotest.sh

From here on, you can look into the source, and start building your very own applications.

Have fun!
