% Short description/overview of module functions
This module allows the user to join and leave IGMP multicast groups. Currently only IGMP2 is supported.


\subsection{pico\_igmp2\_join\_group}

\subsubsection*{Description}
Join an IGMP2 multicast group.

\subsubsection*{Function prototype}
\texttt{int pico\_igmp2\_join\_group(struct pico\_ip4 *group\_address, struct pico\_ipv4\_link *link);}

\subsubsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{group\_address} - the address of the multicast group you want to join.
\item \texttt{link} - the link on which that multicast group should be joined.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Example}


\subsection{pico\_igmp2\_leave\_group}

\subsubsection*{Description}
leave an IGMP2 multicast group.

\subsubsection*{Function prototype}
\texttt{int pico\_igmp2\_leave\_group(struct pico\_ip4 *group\_address, struct pico\_ipv4\_link *link);}

\subsubsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{group\_address} - the address of the multicast group you want to leave.
\item \texttt{link} - the link on which that multicast group should be left.
\end{itemize}
